Absolutely. Here is a detailed documentation for your ESP32-based e-paper aircraft tracker project.
✈️ ESP32 E-Paper Aircraft Tracker

Real-time flight info display using OpenSky Network & e-paper
📦 Project Overview

This project uses an ESP32 microcontroller with a 4.2" e-paper display to show nearby aircraft in real time using data from the OpenSky Network. It supports:

    📡 Live aircraft fetch via OpenSky REST API

    🌐 Configurable Wi-Fi & credentials via captive portal

    🌍 Time zone-aware timestamp rendering

    ✈️ Aircraft model metadata via PlaneSpotters + OpenSky

    📟 E-paper display with flicker-free partial updates

    🧠 On-device caching of aircraft info (up to 30 entries)

🧱 Hardware Requirements
Component	Notes
ESP32 (any dev board)	With at least 4MB flash
Waveshare 4.2" e-paper	epd4in2_V2 model
Pushbutton	Used for entering Config Mode
Optional power source	USB, LiPo, etc.

⚙️ How It Works
1. Boot & Config Mode

    On boot, if GPIO 2 is held LOW, the ESP32 enters Config Mode

    A Wi-Fi AP ESP_Config is created

    The user connects and fills:

        WiFi SSID & Password

        OpenSky Client ID + Secret

        Home Lat, Lon, Zoom level

        Timezone and 24h format toggle

    These values are saved to Preferences

2. Normal Mode

    WiFi connects using saved credentials

    OpenSkyAuthClient fetches a valid token

    Every 15 seconds:

        Nearby aircraft are queried

        Positions are filtered by bounding box (based on zoom)

        For each new aircraft:

            Metadata is fetched from PlaneSpotters/OpenSky

            Model, callsign, bearing, and distance are cached

    Aircraft data is displayed:

        Model on Line 1

        Info on Line 2: Callsign + distance + direction + country

3. Display Modes

    If no aircraft nearby:

        Time and date are shown with no aircraft nearby message

        This screen uses partial updates to avoid flicker

    If aircraft are nearby:

        Up to 5 aircraft shown in alternating inverted color blocks

        Header shows time and aircraft count

🧠 Key Features
✅ Timezone-Aware Clock

    TZ_minutes calculated from dropdown (e.g., +05:30)

    Applies offset before formatting time with strftime

✅ Caching

    AircraftCacheEntry[] holds:

        icao24, model, callsign, distance, bearing, active

    cacheIndex cycles through 30-slot ring buffer

    sortAircraftCacheByDistance() helps prioritize closest craft

✅ Flicker-Free Display

    E-paper updates are:

        Partial for aircraft & time refresh

        Full only when switching display modes (e.g., from no aircraft → aircraft found)

🔧 Setup (PlatformIO)
platformio.ini

[env:esp32dev]
platform = espressif32
board = esp32dev
framework = arduino
lib_deps =
  bblanchon/ArduinoJson@^6.21.3
  # Add your e-paper library
build_flags =
  -DCORE_DEBUG_LEVEL=3

🔐 OpenSky Credentials

To get a client ID/secret:

    Register at OpenSky REST

    Use the credentials in the Config Portal

    Your access token is auto-refreshed when expired

🚦 How to Use
✅ First Boot

    Hold button connected to GPIO 2 LOW

    Connect to ESP_Config WiFi

    Go to http://192.168.4.1

    Fill form and hit Save

✅ Normal Operation

    Every 15s, display updates automatically

    Shows:

        Live aircraft

        Model + Callsign

        Compass direction and distance

📌 Future Ideas

    Add aircraft icons / pixel graphics

    Use barometric data to show altitude

    Add BLE or MQTT for remote commands

    Store history in SPIFFS or SD card

    Implement paginated aircraft lists
